- Allow each algorithm to implement describe_params?

- Make UI interface more generic

	- Add command line interface
	
	- Add Tk interface

- New input types:

	- Sublist (contains other items, will be indented)

	- Text (??)
		- Perhaps an "Extended text field" for all fields?

- Add preliminary New Jersey support

- For machine readable passports, handle the ligatures and
  special chracters.  Dangerous to try and decode (perhaps
  offer options), but we should certainly encode them.
