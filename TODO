- Allow each algorithm to implement describe_params?

- Make UI interface more generic

	- Add command line interface
	
	- Add Tk interface

- New input types:

	- Sublist (contains other items, will be indented)

	- Allow radio boxes to have different labels from values

	- Drop list support
		- Ooooh, better idea, change radio to "choice", let UI
		  code look at (scalar(@options)) to decide if list is
		  long enough to justify a drop list, otherwise radio.
		  Keen!

	- Text (??)
		- Perhaps an "Extended text field" for all fields?

- Add preliminary New Jersey support

- Add New York pre-1992 support
