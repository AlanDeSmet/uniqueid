# Unique ID
#
# Experimental implementation for algorithms as described on the Unique ID web
# site (http://www.highprogrammer.com/alan/numbers/)
#
# This program is intended to be run as a CGI (Common Gateway Interface)
# running under a web server like Apache (http://www.apache.org).  You can find
# further information about CGIs here http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/ You will
# want to consult the documentation for your web server for details on how to
# install a CGI.  This program requires Perl (http://www.perl.org/) and the
# Perl modules CGI (http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=CGI.pm) and
# Text::Soundex (http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Text-Soundex).
#
# The author is not able to help with installation of a web server, perl, perl
# modules, or CGI programs.
